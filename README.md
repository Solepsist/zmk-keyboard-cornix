# ZMK Keyboard for Cornix + Dongle


This branch is tuned for a dongle setup: SSD1315 128x64 OLED on I2C + Pro Micro NRF52840 (nice!nano V2.0).
Just build `.uf2` and flash the files on the stock nosd bootloader.

2. **Edit Your Keymap**
   - Locate the keymap file in `config/cornix.keymap` (or whichever `.keymap` file you want to customize).

     - Open the editor and load your `.keymap` file.
     - Make changes with the visual editor.
     - Download the updated file and replace it in your repository.
     - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

3. **Build with GitHub Actions**
   - After pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically run the build.
   - Once the workflow finishes, go to **Actions → your latest run → Artifacts** and download the firmware (`.uf2`) files.

4. **Flash Your Keyboard**
   - Put your board into UF2 bootloader mode (usually by double-tapping the reset button).
   - Drag and drop the `.uf2` file onto the mounted drive.
